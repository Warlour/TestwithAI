# Test with AI
In this project, I will try to learn more about Artificial Intelligence using PyTorch.

## Why?
As of 24/05-2022, I have almost no knowledge and no understanding of constructing an AI. I seek to further my knowledge by starting off with PyTorch, as I have read this library is "more clear and developer-friendly"[<sup>1</sup>](https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-spotting-the-difference-25c75777377b "PyTorch vs TensorFlow â€” spotting the difference. Line "). I have worked with TensorFlow once before, and while I was successful in building an AI that could differentiate between hand-written numbers, my understanding of AI was virtually not increased.

## How?
I will be starting off with simple tutorials, which I will find from relevant google searches.
